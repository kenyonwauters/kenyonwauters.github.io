<h1>Is Buddhism Beneficial</h1>

<p>
I found myself in a Theravada Buddhist meditation center because
I wanted to meet people who meditated, and possibly find a meditation
teacher.  I had no interest in Buddhism but neither no aversion,
and as it seemed the Buddhists had the concession on meditation,
to the Buddhists I went.  The Theravada was my third group, the
first two both had "Buddhist" and "meditation" in their names
but were pretty light on both.
</p>

<p>
The Theravada group was different.  Thirty minute sits for starters,
which
seemed very hard-core to me at the time.  Very social after the
sit so I quickly met the goal of meeting like-minded people,
plus we had direct and detailed instructions from two
always-smiling "bald-pated
recluses" with odd accents and the unmistakable robes. They were
very much available before and after the sits for any questions I and
my friends might have.
</p>

<p>So I stayed.</p>

<h2>Encountering The Claims</h2>

<p>
From time to time, the monks would state the central claim of
Theravada Buddhism, which was that, through diligent practice
and based solely on human effort, a person could, "in this
very life", realize a total escape from suffering. 
</p>

<p>
This was news to me.  Up to this point I had carried
around an idea of The Buddha picked
up somewhere in adolescence and never afteward examined, of
an "enlightened" being.  I literally had a picture in my
head formed decades earlier of a human figure with light
shining out of his eyes.  
</p>

<p>
So I began to investigate, and discovered my ideas of
enlightenment were
hopelessly knotted up in Western concepts of the mundane versus
supernatural, so I could not help but to think of him as being
in the supernatural category.  This meant that, like Jesus, his
followers might imitate him, but only so far, and not that far
at that.
</p>

<p>
Now the question became whether there was something within
Buddhism, besides meditation, that would warrant further
study and possibly investment.
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma Versus Buddhism</h2>

<p>
The group was a few weeks into a reading of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majjhima_Nik%C4%81ya"
   >Majjhima Nikaya</a>, so as luck would have it I was introduced
to the "Dhamma" as found in the <a
   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81li_Canon">Pali Canon</a>.
</p>

<p>
About a third of the way through the Majjhima Nikaya (MN), I gained
an impression apparently shared by many over the centuries.  While
the MN contains obviously sectarian syncretic cruft, a large part
of it simply felt, through accumulated exposure, 
as it if were the original thinking of a single
individual.  We will call that individual "The Buddha" because why
not, and assume he was the guy born Siddhatta Gotoma and who called
himself the "Tathagata" which is clumsily translated as "thus gone",
though I prefer a more idiomatic translation as "Been there, done
that."
</p>

<p>
So when I say, "The Buddha said..." I mean my own sense of that
specific individual whose personality and thinking comes through the
cruft, specifically within the Pali Canon.
</p>

<p>
As for whether Buddhism
So to spoil the ending, Buddhism did not emerge as particularly
useful to me except in a very narrow and specific instance. 
</p>



<p>
Buddhism is completely fluid, it assumes the shape of its container.
Or we can think of it as an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha">Aggregate</a>, as solid as it appears from a distance,
it becomes less solid the closer you get, and dissolves to the touch.
</p>

<p>
Clearly Therefore Buddhism as a broad term is of no interest to me because
it does not mean anything.  
<p>
However, there are quite a few people who call themselves Buddhists,
even monks, who have put out great effort to expose the Dhar

<h2>Which Dhamma</h2>

<p>
Let's first clarify the term Dhamma.  The word itself is the
Pali language version of the more popular sanskrit word
"Dharma".  Dhamma is one of those words that can mean almost
anything depending on context, but there is only one that I 
refer to as not a logical system.  But there is another worth
mentioning before we get to that.
</p>

<p>The first meaning for the Dhamma
is the complete set of natural laws of interest
to anybody wishing to free themselves of suffering. Like
gravity, it exists whether or not we investigate it or discover
precise formulations of its nature.  Siddhatta Gotoma, later
called The Buddha, did claim to have discovered this set
of laws, and he further claimed to provide a precise
formulation of them.  That precise formulation is itself the second
meaning of the word Dhamma.  When used casually by a typical
Buddhist, "The Dhamma" means the Buddha's precisely worded
description of those natural laws, plus the process
to put oneself in a domain where 
those laws are not in effect.
</p>

<p>This essay refers to Dhamma in the second sense, the teachings
of Siddhatta Gotoma, whom I will refer to as The Buddha going 
forward.
</p>

<p>Also: Insert long explanation here that any use of the phrase
"The Buddha said..." always means, "As best we can tell from the
Pali Canon, the oldest surviving texts claiming to state the
words of The Buddha, the following statement is reasonbly well
aligned with those of the Canon that scholars believe most likely
to be the thoughts of a single individual, heretofore and whenceforth
and etc and so forth and you get the idea."
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Logical</h2>

<p>The Dhamma is not a set of axioms from which we can build theorems
and deduce new information.  It is advertised as containing all the
facts necessary to the task.  If it is not possible to derive
theorems, then it is not a logical system as I was taught them.
</p>

<p>It may be precise.  It may be meticulous.  It may describe processes,
and it may as it claims be universally applicable to all human beings,
but it is still not a logical system of axioms and theorems.  
</p>

<p>So pursuing the Dhamma is not an exercise in logic, no matte how
it might appear that way at first due to the highly systematic system
of categories and processes that are described.
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Science</h2>

<p>There is nothing in the Dhamma that can be objectively measured,
and no experiment can verify the subjective claim of an individual
to have freed themselves of suffering.  The Dhamma is not science.
</p>

<p>Even should continuing studies of expert meditators confirm and
elaborate that their brains are different than those of the ordinary
non-meditator, this does not prove any claim of any person to have
followed the Dhamma to liberation and awakening.</p>

<p>If we must make a scientific analogy we could say there are
some similarities between the Dhamma and the Standard Model of
particle physics.  Both contain a lot of detail, including certain
constants whose purpose, number and distribution do not seem
particularly clean or elegant.  Both work very well and both
inspire among their students a desire for something simpler, with
fewer variables.  Perhaps one day there may be a simpler model
for one or the other, but not today.</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Faith</h2>

<p>Which is not say that you can't take just about anything, burn
some insense in front of it, drag the kids to some mind-numbingly
boring ceremonies that run for hours 
on a few select days each year, and
golly gee you've got yourself a true religion that could well
last centuries.</p>

<p>But the Dhamma is not that.  This is why all religionized
versions of "Buddhism" are pretty light on Dhamma, and heavier on
chanting and incense.  Most of them promise rewards in the
next life for good behavior in this one.  Pretty standard stuff
as religions go.</p>

<p>The Dhamma itself explicitly says blind faith is useless.
It is not sinful, as there is no sin in the Dhamma, it is simply
not effective.  The Dhamma requires the reduction of skepticism
to the point of determining whether it is plausible enough so
as to warrant investment.  If the investment pays off, a 
reasonable person would invest further.  That is the only suggestion
made by the Dhamma regarding doubt and faith.
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Cosmology or Theology</h2>

<p>Though The Pali Canon does have a systematic cosmology and
theology, with thirty-two planes of existence and a multitude
of various devas and Brahmas, they appear to be secondary
to this non-scholarly reader.  I have no memory of any of them
where the Buddha is not discussed in the third person, or where
the protagonist is somebody other than the Buddha.  They look like
the sectarian cruft that had accumulated on the canon before
it and the Theravada crystalized into a mutually perpetuating
symbiot.
</p>

<p>There are exceptions.  One of the most brilliantly funny take-downs
of religion I have ever read is in the Digha Nikaya, first Sutta, which
reads very closely like those that seem to spring from the unique mind
of a single individual.  In this story, at the beginning of a universal
epoch, when all living beings exist as wispy vaporous non-sentient ghosts
in a single plane of existence, time begins when the plane of Brahma
expands, and the first "soul" if you will falls from that wispy place
and is born in the Brahma realm as Brahma himself, destined to fill that
role for the entire billions of years of this epoch.  He spends the odd
million years admiring his own beauty and perfection before realizing
he is lonely, and so he wishes for companions.  Unaware of either time
or the workings of cosmology, he soon falls into delusion.  For soon
enough more beings begin to fall from the wispy place and join him
in his Brahma plane.  Seeing the chain of event "my wish - they appear",
he declares himself supreme being of the universe, claiming his very
words have caused his companions to appear.  Funny story, inasmuch as
we are all Brahma.  That is what I have found in all of the useful
stories involving deities, they are analogs to lessons in the Dhamma
that are more explicitly made in Suttas directly describing human
experience.</p>

<p>But short of the odd stories of this or that deva filling the
night with her radiant light as she comes to ask a question of The
Blessed One, the thousands of pages of Dhamma are quite
thoroughly mundane.  The subject matter is decidedly human
experience on the boring but reliable material plane.</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Mystical</h2>

<p>A friend of mine and I were once discussing why it is hard
to discuss meditation with non-meditators.  She put it very
simply, "Because you sound like you're stoned."  Who needs it?
</p>

<p>But it does sound mystical.  It works like this.  You begin
to meditate, and early on as your mind calms down you realize
you were mistaken on some small matter that occurred that day
or that week.  Then you realize you were mistaken on some larger
issues.  Then somebody asks how you are doing and you reply,
"Isn't it odd that we live our lives in a state of delusion?"
Or maybe you keep it to yourself and talk about Covid.
</p>

<p>It seems to me that committed meditators develop a lingo to
describe their experience, as any group does, as the Buddha himself
did.  Describing experiences and insights outside of common 
experience, experiences around the concentrated and prolonged 
experience of body sensations and mental patterns, will make you
sound mystical.  But it remains mundane body and mind.
</p>

<h2>The Medical Model</h2>

<p>It is odd that the Dhamma appears logical where it is merely
precise and meticulous, appears to make scientific claims in terms
of universality and repeatability - which can only be subjectively
confirmed, and fills the place of religion by promising the
answer to the only question that matters - why we suffer and what
we can do about it.  It is odd that it resembles those things but is
not any of them.</p>

<p>Nor am I about to unveil some astonishing new theory of how
the Dhamma synthesizes all of those.  Nope.  It is not that either.
</p>

<p>After some years of study and practice I have concluded the Dhamma is exactly
what it claims to be, which is best understood with a medical
analogy.</p>

<p>The Dhamma describes symptoms, suffering or stress (Pali: dukkha).
It describe a disease process in which desire, aversion and ignorance
create not just suffering but the conditions for further suffering.
It pronounces the disease curable, and provides the prescription.</p>

<p>Those of course are the four noble truths: symptoms, disease
process, the good news that there is a cure,
and the treatment plan.</p>

<p>As for the vast and elaborate doctrines within the Dhamma 
itself, they all, each and every one, describe either the
symptoms and disease process, or instruct on the treatment plan.
</p>

<p>This is why sometimes people will say "Buddhism is
depressing and pessimistic" by which they mean The Buddha left
us thousands of pages of meticulous and detailed descriptions 
of a disease process.  Books on cancer are depressing if you
think they are descriptions of the entire world.
The Dhamma contains no descriptions of what happens after the
cure, because it does not need to.  Does a doctor tell an otherwise
healthy person what to expect once they are rid of a temporary
condition of disease?  How would the doctor know?  Why would the
doctor care?  

<p>The Dhamma describes where we are, and is relevant only as long
as we are here.  When the course of treatment is complete and the
cure is affected, th
