<h1>The Dhamma is Not a Logical System</h1>

<p>
Let's first clarify the term Dhamma.  The word itself is the
Pali language version of the more popular sanskrit word
"Dharma".  Dhamma is one of those words that can mean almost
anything depending on context, but there are two useful
meanings.
</p>

<p>The first meaning for the Dhamma
is the complete set of natural laws of interest
to anybody wishing to free themselves of suffering. Like
gravity, it exists whether or not we investigate it or discover
precise formulations of its nature.  Sidhatta Gotoma, later
called The Buddha, did claim to have discovered this set
of laws, and he further claimed to provide a precise
formulation of them.  That precise formulation is itself the second
meaning of the word Dhamma.  When used casually by a typical
Buddhist, "The Dhamma" means the Buddha's precisely worded
description of those natural laws, plus the process
to put oneself in a domain where 
those laws are not in effect.
</p>

<p>This essay refers to Dhamma in the second sense, the teachings
of Sidhatta Gotoma, whom I will refer to as The Buddha going 
forward.
</p>

<p>Also: Insert long explanation here that any use of the term
"The Buddha said..." always means, "As best we can tell from the
Pali Canon, the oldest surviving texts claiming to state the
words of The Buddha, it can reasonably be assumed that yada yada
and etc and so forth and you get the idea."
