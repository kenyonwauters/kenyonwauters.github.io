<h1>The Dhamma is Not a Logical System</h1>

<h2>Which Dhamma</h2>

<p>
Let's first clarify the term Dhamma.  The word itself is the
Pali language version of the more popular sanskrit word
"Dharma".  Dhamma is one of those words that can mean almost
anything depending on context, but there is only one that I 
refer to as not a logical system.  But there is another worth
mentioning before we get to that.
</p>

<p>The first meaning for the Dhamma
is the complete set of natural laws of interest
to anybody wishing to free themselves of suffering. Like
gravity, it exists whether or not we investigate it or discover
precise formulations of its nature.  Siddhatta Gotoma, later
called The Buddha, did claim to have discovered this set
of laws, and he further claimed to provide a precise
formulation of them.  That precise formulation is itself the second
meaning of the word Dhamma.  When used casually by a typical
Buddhist, "The Dhamma" means the Buddha's precisely worded
description of those natural laws, plus the process
to put oneself in a domain where 
those laws are not in effect.
</p>

<p>This essay refers to Dhamma in the second sense, the teachings
of Siddhatta Gotoma, whom I will refer to as The Buddha going 
forward.
</p>

<p>Also: Insert long explanation here that any use of the phrase
"The Buddha said..." always means, "As best we can tell from the
Pali Canon, the oldest surviving texts claiming to state the
words of The Buddha, the following statement is reasonbly well
aligned with those of the Canon that scholars believe most likely
to be the thoughts of a single individual, heretofore and whenceforth
and etc and so forth and you get the idea."
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Logical</h2>

<p>The Dhamma is not a set of axioms from which we can build theorems
and deduce new information.  It is advertised as containing all the
facts necessary to the task.  If it is not possible to derive
theorems, then it is not a logical system as I was taught them.
</p>

<p>It may be precise.  It may be meticulous.  It may describe processes,
and it may as it claims be universally applicable to all human beings,
but it is still not a logical system of axioms and theorems.  
</p>

<p>So pursuing the Dhamma is not an exercise in logic, no matte how
it might appear that way at first due to the highly systematic system
of categories and processes that are described.
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Science</h2>

<p>There is nothing in the Dhamma that can be objectively measured,
and no experiment can verify the subjective claim of an individual
to have freed themselves of suffering.  The Dhamma is not science.
</p>

<p>Even should continuing studies of expert meditators confirm and
elaborate that their brains are different than those of the ordinary
non-meditator, this does not prove any claim of any person to have
followed the Dhamma to liberation and awakening.</p>


<h2>The Dhamma is Not Faith</h2>

<p>Which is not say that you can't take just about anything, burn
some insense in front of it, drag the kids to some mind-numbingly
boring ceremonies that run for hours 
on a few select days each year, and
golly gee you've got yourself a true religion that could well
last centuries.</p>

<p>But the Dhamma is not that.  This is why all religionized
versions of "Buddhism" are pretty light on Dhamma, and heavier on
chanting and incense.  Most of them promise rewards in the
next life for good behavior in this one.  Pretty standard stuff
as religions go.</p>

<p>The Dhamma itself explicitly says blind faith is useless.
It is not sinful, as there is no sin in the Dhamma, it is simply
not effective.  The Dhamma requires the reduction of skepticism
to the point of determining whether it is plausible enough so
as to warrant investment.  If the investment pays off, a 
reasonable person would invest further.  That is the only suggestion
made by the Dhamma regarding doubt and faith.
</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Cosmology or Theology</h2>

<p>Though The Pali Canon does have a systematic cosmology and
theology, with thirty-two planes of existence and a multitude
of various devas and Brahmas, they appear to be secondary
to this non-scholarly reader.  I have no memory of any of them
where the Buddha is not discussed in the third person, or where
the protagonist is somebody other than the Buddha.  They look like
the sectarian cruft that had accumulated on the canon before
it and the Theravada crystalized into a mutually perpetuating
symbiot.
</p>

<p>There are exceptions.  One of the most brilliantly funny take-downs
of religion I have ever read is in the Digha Nikaya, first Sutta, which
reads very closely like those that seem to spring from the unique mind
of a single individual.  In this story, at the beginning of a universal
epoch, when all living beings exist as wispy vaporous non-sentient ghosts
in a single plane of existence, time begins when the plane of Brahma
expands, and the first "soul" if you will falls from that wispy place
and is born in the Brahma realm as Brahma himself, destined to fill that
role for the entire billions of years of this epoch.  He spends the odd
million years admiring his own beauty and perfection before realizing
he is lonely, and so he wishes for companions.  Unaware of either time
or the workings of cosmology, he soon falls into delusion.  For soon
enough more beings begin to fall from the wispy place and join him
in his Brahma plane.  Seeing the chain of event "my wish - they appear",
he declares himself supreme being of the universe, claiming his very
words have caused his companions to appear.  Funny story, inasmuch as
we are all Brahma.  That is what I have found in all of the useful
stories involving deities, they are analogs to lessons in the Dhamma
that are more explicitly made in Suttas directly describing human
experience.</p>

<p>But short of the odd stories of this or that deva filling the
night with her radiant light as she comes to ask a question of The
Blessed One, the thousands of pages of Dhamma are quite
thoroughly mundane.</p>

<h2>The Dhamma is Not Mystical</h2>

<p>A friend of mine and I were once discussing why it is hard
to discuss meditation with non-meditators.  She put it very
simply, "Because you sound like you're stoned."  Who needs it?
</p>


<h2>The Medical Model</h2>

<p>It is odd that the Dhamma appears logical where it is merely
precise and meticulous, appears to make scientific claims in terms
of universality and repeatability - which can only be subjectively
confirmed, and fills the place of religion by promising the
answer to the only question that matters - why we suffer and what
we can do about it.  It is odd that it resembles those things but is
not any of them.</p>

<p>Nor am I about to unveil some astonishing new theory of how
the Dhamma synthesizes all of those.  Nope.  It is not that either.
</p>

<p>After some years of study I have concluded the Dhamma is exactly
what it claims to be, which is best understood with a medical
analogy.</p>

<p>The Dhamma describes symptoms, suffering or stress (Pali: dukkha).
It describe a disease process in which desire, aversion and ignorance
create not just suffering but the conditions for further suffering.
It pronounces the disease curable, and provides the prescription.</p>

<p>Those of course are the four noble truths: symptoms, disease
process, the good news that there is a cure,
and the treatment plan.</p>

<p>As for the vast and elaborate doctrines within the Dhamma 
itself, they all, each and every one, describe either the
symptoms and disease process, or instruct on the treatment plan.
</p>

<p>This is why sometimes people will say "Buddhism is
depressing and pessimistic" by which they mean The Buddha left
us thousands of pages of meticulous and detailed descriptions 
of a disease process.  Books on cancer are depressing if you
think they are descriptions of the entire world.
The Dhamma contains no descriptions of what happens after the
cure, because it does not need to.  Does a doctor tell an otherwise
healthy person what to expect once they are rid of a temporary
condition of disease?  How would the doctor know?  Why would the
doctor care?  

<p>The Dhamma describes where we are, and is relevant only as long
as we are here.  When the course of treatment is complete and the
cure is affected, th
